# Softmax Exercise

Implemented the softmax cost function in [softmaxCost.m](./softmaxCost.m) and the softmax prediction function in [softmaxPred.m](./softmaxPredict.m). For this exercise, no other files other than those mentioned above are changed.

The purpose of this exercise is to use softmax regression to classify MNIST images.

Prediction result is shown [here](./results.JPG).
